Ludwig moves to Vienna, Austria in 1792 and lives there for the rest of his life. He writes classical music for the piano, orchestra and different groups of instruments.

Schubert love for music grew and so he was given the opportunity to take music lessons from Michael Holzer the church choirmaster and organist. Schubert started to perform before public audiences while he was a part of his father’s string quartet. His involvement in his father’s string quartet gave him the opportunity to write several compositions for their string ensemble.

He was of Irish, and some Welsh and English, ancestry. In the mid-1950s, he formed his first band, The Quarrymen (after Quarry Bank High School, which he attended) who, with the addition of Paul McCartney and George Harrison, later became The Beatles.

After some years of performing in Liverpool and Hamburg, Germany, "Beatlemania" erupted in England and Europe in 1963 after the release of their singles "Love Me Do" and "Please Please Me". The next year the Beatles flew to America to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show (1948) (aka The Ed Sullivan Show), and Beatlemania spread worldwide.
